This directory contains a few tools that are built with the DynamicDataObjects Library. 


1.  DataObjectInstaller32.exe - This is a simple nsis installer that will install the three tools listed below.  This is the easiest way to get everything setup correctly as it will register the supported file formats with windows to easily edit these files with the editor and it will register the explorer plugin. 

2.  DataObjectEditor.exe - This is a simple executable that will open any of the files supported by the dataObjects serializers.  It is very fast and can handle very large files in the tree-orientated UI. 

3.  DataObjPreviewer.dll - This is a windows explorer preview plugin that will show the contents of any of the supported formats in the windows explorer preview side-panel.   This must be registered with "regsvr32 DataObjPreviewer.dll"

4.  DataObj.exe - This is a simple command line tool that lets you convert from any of the supported formats to any other format from within the command shell.  For example:  ".\DataObj.exe -i *.cbor -f json -od c:\temp" will take all cbor files in the current directory and convert them to corresponding json files and place them into the c:\temp directory.
